# Machine-Learning-with-MNIST
This report is aimed at building a binary classification algorithm by using Logistic regression and KNN. The dataset was from Fashion-MNIST, where containing 60,000 examples in training set and 10,000 examples in test set. Each example is a 28 x 28 single channel grayscale images, associated with label from one of ten classes.
